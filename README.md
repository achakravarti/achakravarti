### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Abhishek Chakravarti, and I live and work in Kolkata, India. I'm currently working at Live After 60, where I have the opportunity to pursue my interest in developing web applications in the C programming language. I tend to believe that the C language can be used almost as effectively as higher level modern languages such as Python, and I'm grateful to have the chance to experiment with this idea at my work place.

I'm also very happy to be associated with the RefPerSys Project under the mentorship and support of Basile Starynkevitch. RefPerSys is a research project in Artifical Intelligence, building on the ideas of the late Jacques Pitrat. I've learned a lot from the RefPerSys Project, and especially find its goal of generating code on the fly using metaprogramming techniques particularly fascinating.
